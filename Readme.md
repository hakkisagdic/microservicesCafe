# Microservices Cafe

## Introduction

This workshop aims to introduce participants to the main concepts of a Microservices Architecture, Azure Serverless and Azure PaaS Services. You will work through an example of deploying a microservices application that simulates a process of ordering a cup coffee from your favorite coffee house. 

During this lab you will deploy and use and number of Azure PaaS and Serverless services, you will create and deploy a number of microservices, configure and combine the services into a working end to end application. Finally you will look at how Azure Services can be used to make the application resilient and scalable.

The application you will be building will allow the users to order a cup of coffee from a fictional coffee house called Microservices Cafe. A set of microservices comprising this Microservices Cafe application will capture the order via a RESTful API, simulate the process of making the order and finally dispatching the order by notifying the user via an SMS text message.
